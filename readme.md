Robust Fraud Detection for E-commerce and Bank Transactions
==========================================================
Overview
=======

This project focuses on building robust fraud detection systems for both e-commerce and bank credit transactions. The goal is to design machine learning models that detect fraudulent activities with high precision, while balancing the trade-off between security and user experience.

Fraud detection is a critical challenge in financial technology. False positives (flagging genuine transactions as fraud) frustrate customers, while false negatives (failing to catch fraud) result in direct financial loss. Our models aim to minimize both risks, while supporting real-time monitoring and explainability.

Development Setup
=================
Create virtual environment :
We have used Windows with Python 3.13

python -m venv .venv

.venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies
===================
pip install -r requirements.txt

General System Architecture
==========================

Will add after final System Developed.

Data and Features
================

The project uses transactional datasets containing:

    Transaction metadata (amount, time, payment method, etc.)

    Customer and merchant information (e.g., geolocation, IP address)

    Temporal features (hour of the day, day of the week, seasonal patterns)

    Behavioral features (transaction frequency, purchase history)

Feature engineering includes:

    Geolocation-based fraud patterns 

    Time-based behavior 

    Transaction sequence patterns 

    Outlier and anomaly detection 

Project Outcomes

    Understand fraud detection challenges in fintech.

    Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to uncover fraud patterns.

    Apply feature engineering techniques for fraud detection.

    Build, train, and evaluate ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forests, XGBoost, LSTM, Neural Nets).

    Use model interpretability tools (SHAP, LIME) to explain fraud predictions.

    Design strategies to balance false positives vs false negatives.

    Present insights and recommendations to stakeholders.
